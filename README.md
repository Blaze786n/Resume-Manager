# Resume-Manager

Resume Manager is a web-based platform that allows students to create, view, and edit their professional profiles. Agencies or recruiters can access a read-only version of the student's profile, ensuring privacy and integrity of information. The system supports secure role-based access: students have full control over their profiles, while external viewers are restricted to view-only permissions.
